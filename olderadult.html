<p>  Keep in regular contact with loved ones, for example by telephone, e-mail, social media or video conference.
Keep regular routines and schedules as much as possible for eating, sleeping, and activities you enjoy.
Learn simple daily physical exercises to do at home when in quarantine so you can maintain mobility.
Find out how to get practical help if needed, like calling a taxi, having food delivered or asking for medical care. Make sure you have a one-month supply or longer of your regular medicines. Ask family members, friends or neighbours for support, if needed.
