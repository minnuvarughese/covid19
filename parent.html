  <p id="m">  In times of stress, it is common for children to seek more of your attention.</p>

  <h3 class="display-3">  What you can do:</h3>

  <p>Maintain familiar routines as much as possible, or create new ones, especially if you must stay at home.</li>
  <li>  Discuss the new coronavirus with your children in an honest way, using age-appropriate language.</li>
    <li>Support your children with at-home learning and make sure time is set aside for play.</li>
<li>    Help children find positive ways to express feelings such as fear and sadness. Sometimes engaging in a creative activity, such as playing or drawing, can help you with this process.</li>
    <li>Help children stay in contact with friends and family members through telephone and online channels.</li>
    <li>Make sure that your children have time away from screens every day and spend time doing off-line activities together. Do something creative: draw a picture, write a poem, build something. Bake a cake. Sing or dance, or play in your garden, if you have one.</li>
    <li>Try and ensure that your children do not spend significantly more time than usual on video games.</li></p>
